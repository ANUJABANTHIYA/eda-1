# Problem Description

The most difficult part on pricing a house is that, there are many variables that involved. Those may include locations, year the house built, accessability to the public places, and so on. The end goal is to predict the sales price for each house. For each ID in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. 

But for this class, we will just perform Exploratory Data Analysis. 

Data was taken from this Kaggle website for our learning purpose on IYKRA DATA MBA Program. Here is the link source: 

https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques. 

Data contains 79 variables which can be seen the description here:

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

# Loading Packages
```{r}
#Install if the package doesn't exist 
#install.packages('DataExplorer') 
library(DataExplorer)
#install.packages('corrplot')
library(corrplot)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Loading Dataset 

```{r}
housing_train <- read.csv("dataset/train.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
housing_test <- read.csv("dataset/test.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
```

# Initial Data Checking
## Variables
The very first thing that you’d want to do in your EDA is checking the dimension of the input dataset and the time of variables.

```{r}
plot_str(housing_train) 
```

## Checking Data Size 
```{r}
dim(housing_train)
```
```{r}
dim(housing_test)
```

## Checking Data Types 

```{r}
str(housing_train) 
```
Getting rid of the IDs but keeping the test Ids in a vector. These are needed to compose the submission file
```{r}
test_labels <- housing_test$Id
housing_test$Id <- NULL
housing_train$Id <- NULL
```
```{r}
housing_test$SalePrice <- NA
all <- rbind(housing_train, housing_test)
dim(all)
```
Without the Id’s, the dataframe consists of 79 predictors and our response variable SalePrice.

## Checking Missing value 
It’s very important to see if the input data given for Analysis has got Missing values before diving deep into the analysis.
```{r}
plot_missing(all[,c(1:10)])
```
```{r}
plot_missing(all[,c(11:30)])
```
```{r}
plot_missing(all[,c(31:50)])
```
```{r}
plot_missing(all[,c(51:70)])
```
```{r}
plot_missing(all[,c(71:79)])
```
By checking missing value, we might remove some columns unnessecary because of more than 50% missing such as Fence, MiscFeature, PoolQC, 


# Variation WITHIN each variable 

## Histogram 
First we try the histogram of SalesPrice


```{r}
plot_histogram(all$SalePrice)
```
```{r}
summary(all$SalePrice)
```


Before we begin to implement all the variable visualization (which are too tedious), we need to select the importance feature that can affect Sales Prediction. We'll use correlation. 

```{r}
numericVars <- which(sapply(all, is.numeric)) #index vector numeric variables
numericVarNames <- names(numericVars) #saving names vector for use later on
cat('There are', length(numericVars), 'numeric variables')
```
```{r}
all_numVar <- all[, numericVars]
cor_numVar <- cor(all_numVar, use="pairwise.complete.obs") #correlations of all numeric variables

#sort on decreasing correlations with SalePrice
cor_sorted <- as.matrix(sort(cor_numVar[,'SalePrice'], decreasing = TRUE))
 #select only high corelations
CorHigh <- names(which(apply(cor_sorted, 1, function(x) abs(x)>0.5)))
cor_numVar <- cor_numVar[CorHigh, CorHigh]

corrplot.mixed(cor_numVar, tl.col="black", tl.pos = "lt")
```
Top 10 numeric variables are 
- OverallQual
- GrLivArea
- GarageCars
- GarageArea
- TotalBsmtSF
- X1stFlrSF
- FullBath
- TotRmsAbvGrd
- YearBuilt
- YearRemodAdd


# Plot Histogram
```{r}
plot_histogram(all$OverallQual)
```
```{r}
plot_histogram(all$GrLivArea)
```

# Covarian between Variables 

## Two continuous Variables 
```{r}

ggplot(data=all[!is.na(all$SalePrice),], aes(x=OverallQual, y=SalePrice))+
        geom_point(col='blue') + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE, color="black", aes(group=1))


```


Using plot_scatterplot function. 
```{r}
plot_scatterplot(all[!is.na(all$SalePrice),c("SalePrice","GrLivArea")], by="SalePrice") 
```
Using plot_scatterplot function. 
```{r}
plot_scatterplot(all[!is.na(all$SalePrice),c("SalePrice","GarageCars")], by="SalePrice") 
```


## One Continuous One Category

MSZoning and SalePrice
```{r}
ggplot(data=all[!is.na(all$SalePrice),], aes(x=factor(MSZoning), y=SalePrice))+
        geom_boxplot(col='blue') + labs(x='MSZoning')
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=all[!is.na(all$SalePrice),], aes(x=factor(Street), y=SalePrice))+
        geom_boxplot(col='blue') + labs(x='Street')
```
```{r}
ggplot(data=all[!is.na(all$SalePrice),], aes(x=factor(SaleCondition), y=SalePrice))+
        geom_boxplot(col='blue') + labs(x='Sale Condition') 
```

```{r}
plot_boxplot(all[!is.na(all$SalePrice),c("SalePrice","SaleCondition")],by="SaleCondition")
```
```{r}
plot_scatterplot(all[!is.na(all$SalePrice),c("SalePrice","SaleType")],by="SaleType")
```

# Summary 

Please continue!

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
